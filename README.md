# Review-sentylis
Our project is about building a machine learning model
which analyzes review based on performance thereby generating a score and use sentimental analysis to check the polarity
of situation wherein it can be a deciding factor. We also aim at
building a model which generates a graphical representation of
the data generated after cleaning the dataset, we tend to remove
unpleasant or derogatory terms which affects the mental well
being of users or people who reads the reviews, last but not
least we plan on automating this manual labor thus reducing
the time which the user of the product spends on it and creating
a safe and healthy platform for all.

Sentiment Analysis is a popular in machine learning to
analyze the text and find the polarity like positive and negative.
We use the sentiment analysis in machine learning model to
predict the emotion of a people based on the text written.
While working on this project we mainly relied on the
sentimental analysis factor which these days has been a go
to approach for almost each and every platform not only its
one of the most used common approach but also it has a wide
range of usefulness like • Emotion detection • Aspect based
analysis. • Multilingual sentiment analysis. And comes with
many benefits like • Scaling and sorting of data • Real time
analysis • Time saving factor
• NOTE: we used open-source tools to create and train and
build our own mode
