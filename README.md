# review-sentylis
Our project is about building a machine learning model
which analyzes review based on performance thereby generating a score and use sentimental analysis to check the polarity
of situation wherein it can be a deciding factor. We also aim at
building a model which generates a graphical representation of
the data generated after cleaning the dataset, we tend to remove
unpleasant or derogatory terms which affects the mental well
being of users or people who reads the reviews, last but not
least we plan on automating this manual labor thus reducing
the time which the user of the product spends on it and creating
a safe and healthy platform for all.
